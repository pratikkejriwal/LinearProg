# Linear Programming
Implementation of Linear Programming, a basic Machine Learning algorithm.

Linear Programming (also known as Linear Optimization), is a simple optimization technique where we try to simplify complex relationships in terms of linear functions and then find optimum points in such linear functions, so as to achieve the best outcome (either as lowest cost or as maximum profit).

## Problem
A car company produces 2 models, model A and model B. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least 100 model A cars and 80 model B cars each day. Because of limitations on production capacity, no more than 200 model A cars and 170 model B cars can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 200 cars much be shipped each day. If each model A car sold results in a \$2000 loss, but each model B car produces a \$5000 profit, how many of each type should be made daily to maximize net profits?
