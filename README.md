# Linear Programming
Implementation of Linear Programming, a basic Machine Learning algorithm.
Linear Programming (also known as Linear Optimization), is a simple optimization technique where we try to simplify complex relationships in terms of linear functions and then find optimum points in such linear functions, so as to achieve the best outcome (either as lowest cost or as maximum profit).
